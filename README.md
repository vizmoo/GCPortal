# GCPortal
## Web Portal for GC

### How to run on web/ios/android:
- Clone the repo locally, if you haven't already
- Open a new terminal
- Navigate to the `/GCPortal-dev` directory if you aren't already there
- Run `yarn start` to start the development server
- Once it is running, you can open the app on a platform by pressing:
    - `w` for web
    - `i` for ios (MacOS + [XCode CLI Tools](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/) are required)
    - `a` for android ([JDK v21](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/#jdk21)  + [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio) + [Emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/) are required. May also need to [update environmental variable $ANDROID_HOME](https://developer.android.com/tools/variables))
